The UNIX OS was totally written in C. Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language. 
C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions.
Some examples of the use of C are - Operating Systems. Language Compilers. Assemblers. Text Editors. Print Spoolers. Network Drivers. Modern Programs. Databases. Language Interpreters. Utilities.
C language is considered as the mother language of all the modern programming languages because most of the compilers, JVMs, Kernels, etc. are written in C language, and most of the programming languages follow C syntax, for example, C++, Java, C#, etc. It provides the core concepts like the array, strings, functions, file handling, etc. that are being used in many languages like C++, Java, C#, etc.
