# static
/**
^ the static storage class can be used on local and global variables, as well as functions
^when applied to local variables it instructs the compiler to keep the variabel in existence during the life-time of the program
^when applied to global variables, the static modifier causes that variables scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared and  same applies for functions
