# bit Manipulation

## Computer Programming tasks that require bit manipulation include
###         1.low-level device control
###         2.error-detection
###         3.correction algorithms
###         4.data compression
###         5.encryption algorithms
###         6.optimization

## a bitwise operations operates on one or more binary numbers at the level of their individual bits
###     1.used to manipulate values for comparisons and calculations
###     2.substantially faster than division, several times faster than multiplication, and sometimes significantly faster than addition
